                    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
                    <p>Lily was a little girl<br>
                    Afraid of the big, wide world<br>
                    She grew up within her castle walls<br>
                    Now and then she tried to run<br>
                    And then on the night with the setting sun<br>
                    She went in the woods away<br>
                    So afraid, all alone.<br>
                    They warned her, don't go there<br>
                    There's creatures who are hiding in the dark<br>
                    Then something came creeping<br>
                    It told her, don't you worry just<br><br>
                    
                    Follow everywhere I go<br>
                    Top of all the mountains or valley low<br>
                    Give you everything you've been dreaming of<br>
                    Just let me in, ooh<br>
                    Everything you want in gold<br>
                    I'll be the magic story you've been told<br>
                    And you'll be safe under my control<br>
                    Just let me in, ooh<br>
                    Just let me in, ooh<br><br>
                    
                    She knew she was hypnotized<br>
                    And walking on cold thin ice<br>
                    Then it broke, and she awoke again<br><br>
